# Tech Talk notes
**- Tech Talk 0:**

- **Overarching concept/notes**: Data Structures:
A data structure is a method of organizing data. Think of a variable holding a single integer value(ex: int n=4;) or sequences of numbers(ex: int[] numbers=new int[]{ 1,2,3 };) or tables of data, or databases: these are all well-defined data structures. Data Structures and organizing data will require students to become more algorithmic in coding.
There are many algorithms for different purposes and they interact with different data structures. Think of algorithms as dynamic underlying pieces that interact with data structures. Together, data structures and algorithms combine and allow programmers to build whatever computer programs they’d like. Well managed data structures and algorithms ensures well-optimized and efficient code.

- **Overarching concept/notes**: 
- **Linked List:**
  - Linked list are a way of keeping and managing a list of Objects
  - ABCD have Data and Next pointer
  - E is illustrative of inserting a new Object
  - tmp illustrates accessing the Data from the D Object
**- Queues**:
    - Queues can be built using Linked List Objects
    - A Queue requires keeping track of First In for dequeue extraction (head node)
    - A Queue requires keeping track of the Back for enqueue entry (tail node)
    - A Queue requires keeping track of the Current node for iteration (current node)
    
 - ** java generic t:**
  - A generic type is a generic class or interface that is parameterized over types.” Essentially, generic types allow you to write a general, generic class (or method) that works with different types, allowing for code re-use
