# Tech Talk notes
* Tech Talk 1:

- Overarching concept/notes: Data Structures:
A data structure is a method of organizing data. Think of a variable holding a single integer value(ex: int n=4;) or sequences of numbers(ex: int[] numbers=new int[]{ 1,2,3 };) or tables of data, or databases: these are all well-defined data structures. Data Structures and organizing data will require students to become more algorithmic in coding.
There are many algorithms for different purposes and they interact with different data structures. Think of algorithms as dynamic underlying pieces that interact with data structures. Together, data structures and algorithms combine and allow programmers to build whatever computer programs theyâ€™d like. Well managed data structures and algorithms ensures well-optimized and efficient code.
