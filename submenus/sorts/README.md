# Sorts:
Sort Implementations:
--
- Most used sorts in java include:
- Merge Sort (uses the divide and conquers strategy for sorting elements in an array. It is also a stable sort, meaning that it will not change the order of the original elements in an array concerning each other)
   
- Insertion Sort (While it isn’t a much-optimized algorithm for sorting an array, it is one of the more easily understood ones. Implementation is pretty easy too. In insertion sort, one picks up an element and considers it to be the key)
  
- Selection Sort (Quadratic sorting algorithms are some of the more popular sorting algorithms that are easy to understand and implement. These don’t offer a unique or optimized approach for sorting the array - rather they should offer building blocks for the concept of sorting itself for someone new to it)
  
- Bubble Sort (The two algorithms that most beginners start their sorting career with would be bubble sort and selection sort. These sorting algorithms are not very efficient, but they provide a key insight into what sorting is and how a sorting algorithm works behind the scenes.)

- From this, we can see the time difference, and see the order of effiency for sorts.
